"""AgentCore Platform v1.0 — Graph (CMN-C1-613 ZendeskMacroApplyAgent).

Cat 1, L1-direct AgentBaseGraph. Single capability: apply one existing Zendesk macro
to one ticket from a natural-language instruction, behind a name-resolution →
disambiguation → high-impact confirmation → audited write envelope.

The framework's compile() requires the slots pre_process / main / post_process. The two
read/resolve nodes (macro_list, macro_select) are registered as extra nodes inserted
between pre_process and the main writer slot; add_edges() is overridden to wire them:

    START -> initialize -> pre_process -> macro_list -> macro_select
          -> main -> {route} -> post_process -> finalize -> END

Services are constructor-injected here (stateless, shared) — never built inside
execute(). Config (zendesk_subdomain) comes from config/agent.yaml.
