"""A narrowed S-2 input gate for agents whose SUBJECT is an identifier.

Byte-identical in every template that uses it. What each agent narrows is declared at the
call site, not here, so the decision is visible in that repo's own node.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`FunctionNode._security_gate_input()` masks every `detect_pii` finding in `user_input`,
`validated_input` and `llm_response`, before `execute()` runs. For most agents that is
exactly right: the identifier is incidental to the work.

For a class of SaaS-operation agents it destroys the work itself. Measured 2026-09-03 by
running the graph, not by reading it:

    (internal reference removed) pre_process received: 'Seikyuu mail wa [MASKED] desu.'
    (internal reference removed) pre_process received: 'Refund charge ch_3Abc for 5000 JPY, customer [MASKED]'

The email IS the instruction. Masked, (internal reference removed) answers "No email or customer id found"
on every real request -- an agent that cannot do the one thing it exists to do, while
reporting success.

WHY IT IS DONE THIS WAY
-----------------------
`FunctionNode._security_gate_input` is `@final`: overriding it raises TypeError at class
definition, by design, so the default scan cannot be silently dropped. `_PII_SCAN_FIELDS`
is a module constant in the wheel with no configuration, no environment override and no
trust-level condition -- there is no knob.

`BaseNode._security_gate_input` is `@abstractmethod`, and a node that inherits BaseNode
directly implements it itself. This is a documented, framework-sanctioned position, not a
bypass: `GraphNode` and `RemoteAgentNode` in the wheel both take it, and the framework contract
states that a BaseNode subclass "must override the @abstractmethod versions directly" and
that a deliberate choice there "is not a bypass".

WHAT IS AND IS NOT NARROWED
---------------------------
This gate still masks EVERY PII class the default gate masks, with exactly one exception:
the finding types the agent declares it operates on. Everything else -- names, phone
numbers, national identifiers, payment card numbers -- is masked exactly as before. The
injection check is NOT narrowed: it runs unchanged, on the same fields, with the same
blocking behaviour, because an instruction to the agent is not the same thing as a
customer identifier.

An agent that narrows `email` still masks a phone number in the same sentence. An agent
that narrows nothing gets the default behaviour and should use FunctionNode instead.

WHAT THE CALLER OWES
--------------------
An identifier that survives this gate is ordinary personal data under the agent's care:

* It reaches the provider API, which is the point.
* It must NOT be written into an audit payload -- `emit_trace_event` payloads are
  structured, already-safe fields only.
* It must NOT be echoed into the reply beyond what the reader supplied themselves.
* It IS checkpointed with state, like any other request field. That is processing the
  data the caller sent for this purpose, not storing a credential; a credential in state
 remains forbidden (the framework contract) and this changes nothing about that.
